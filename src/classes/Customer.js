// 1. Dashboard
// As a customer:

// I should see a dashboard page that shows me:
// Any room bookings I have made (past or upcoming)
// The total amount I have spent on rooms

// 2. Customer Interaction
// As a customer:

// I should be able to select a date for which Iâ€™d like to book a room for myself
// Upon selecting a date, I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
// I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
// I should be able to select a room for booking
// In the event that no rooms are available for the date/roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the user and asking them to adjust their room search
